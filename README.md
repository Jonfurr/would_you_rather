## Description

Would you rather is an app for asking and answering "Qould you rather" questions. A logged-in user can view their previously answered questions, answer their unanswered questions, ask new questions, view questions statistics, and view the leaderboard. The leaderboard position is determined based on the total of answered and asked questions.

This app uses React and Redux to maintain a centralized application state. Components access and update state using actions and reducers.
